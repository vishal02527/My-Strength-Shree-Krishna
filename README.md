# 🌸 My-Strength-Shree-Krishna 🌸

🙏 **Hello everyone!** 🙏

I hope you all are doing great. Here are some important points to keep in mind while contributing:

- **Avoid Duplicate Issues**: Don’t create issues that already exist. If none match your interest, only then open a new valid issue.
- **PR Etiquette**: Do not submit a PR unless you've been assigned to an issue.
- **Patience**: I may take some time to respond due to my workload. For urgent concerns, you can ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-kumar-8303a3283).
- **PR Guidelines**: Always mention the issue number in your PR and attach relevant screenshots or demo videos to clarify your changes.

Thanks & Regards,  
**Vishal Kumar**
