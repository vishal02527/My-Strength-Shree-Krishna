        <h2 data-translate="historical-context">Historical and Cultural Context</h2>
        <p data-translate="historical-text">Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to Vyasa. Its longest version consists of over 100,000 śloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Ramayana.</p>

        <h2 data-translate="key-elements">Key Elements</h2>
        <p data-translate="elements-text">The epic contains many philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or puruṣārtha. The most important philosophical discussion is the Bhagavad Gita, which is contained in the Bhishma Parva of the epic.</p>

        <p data-translate="theme-text">The Mahabharata addresses themes such as duty (dharma), righteousness, justice, and the consequences of one’s actions (karma). The complex interplay of fate and free will is also a recurring theme, highlighting the moral dilemmas faced by the characters.</p>

        <h2 data-translate="influence">Influence and Legacy</h2>
        <p data-translate="influence-text">The Mahabharata has had a profound influence on Indian culture, religion, and philosophy. It has inspired numerous adaptations in literature, theater, television, and film. The Bhagavad Gita, as part of this epic, is revered as a sacred scripture and continues to guide spiritual and moral discourse worldwide.</p>

        <h2 data-translate="moral-lessons">Moral Lessons</h2>
